Functions are of 3 kinds, which act on 3 kinds of variables, 
* Char, Numeric and date
* please refer to raw102.adverse DS for reference

## Character Functions
* "contains" can only-be used with Where-stmt

## Numeric Functions
* Notice the difference between total1=pai1+pain2
* and total2=sum(pain1,pain2)

* Ignoring rows with missing variables is the RIGHT way to do
